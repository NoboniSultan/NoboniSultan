# Hi there, I'm Noboni Sultan 👋

Welcome to my corner of GitHub! I'm a frontend developer in training, learning to build things for the web one line of code at a time.

## About Me

I'm on a journey to become a thoughtful frontend developer. What draws me to this work is the chance to create interfaces that feel good to use—clean, accessible, and designed with real people in mind. I believe good code should be as readable as good writing, and I'm working every day to get better at both.

Right now, I'm focused on building a strong foundation and understanding *why* things work, not just *how* to make them work.

## What I'm Working With

Here's what's in my toolkit so far:

- **HTML & CSS** – Building semantic, accessible markup and styling with care
- **JavaScript** – Bringing interactivity to the page and learning to think in logic
- **Flexbox & Grid** – Creating layouts that adapt and respond
- **Responsive Design** – Making sure things look good everywhere

I'm not an expert yet, but I'm comfortable with these tools and getting more confident each day.

## Projects

### 🌐 Personal Portfolio Website
A place to showcase my work and experiments. It's a living project—I keep updating it as I learn new things.

## Learning with AI

I'm using AI tools to help me learn JavaScript faster and more deeply. It's like having a patient tutor who can explain concepts in different ways until they click. I see it as a learning accelerator, not a replacement for understanding—I still write every line myself and make sure I know what it does.

## What I'm Learning Next

- Deepening my JavaScript skills (DOM manipulation, event handling, ES6+ features)
- Exploring modern CSS techniques (animations, custom properties)
- Getting comfortable with Git and version control best practices
- Learning how to break down bigger projects into manageable pieces

## Let's Connect

I'm always happy to connect with other learners and developers. Feel free to reach out if you want to collaborate, share resources, or just say hi.
